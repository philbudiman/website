When I wrapped up rebuilding my personal website—the one you're on right now—I started with just a few pages:  

1. **Home** (featuring my signature animation)  
2. **About** (a quick intro + a link to my resume)  
3. **404** (with a fun donut animation—shoutout to a1k0n’s [donut-math](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html), which I ported to TypeScript)  

Naturally, I wanted to add something more. But what?  

A contact page felt unnecessary—I already link to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and email.  
A dedicated projects or experience page? Redundant, given my resume and LinkedIn.  

I cycled through a few ideas before having an _a-ha_ moment:  

I thought back to the opening scene of The Social Network, where—reeling from a breakup—Zuck drowns his sorrows, comes up with the idea for Facemash, and live-blogs the entire coding spree.

Now, I don’t plan on blogging anything nearly as dramatic, but the idea stuck. A blog felt like the perfect addition—not just as a space to write, but as an interesting engineering challenge to build.
