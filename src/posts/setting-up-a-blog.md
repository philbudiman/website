When I finished re-building my personal website to the one you're on right now, I only had a handful of pages:
1. Home (with the signature animation)
2. About (with an introduction and link to my resume)
3. 404 (with a fun donut animation, credit: a1k0n's [donut-math](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html) for original source code which I ported to TypeScript)

So, naturally, I wanted to add at least one more feature. Thing is, I wasn't sure what I wanted to add.

I didn't feel like adding a contact page was necessary since I already have my LinkedIn, GitHub, and Email linked on the website.

Didn't feel like adding a separate page for projects or experience would make much sense with my resume and LinkedIn already on here.

Went through a few more ideas before I had an _a-ha_ moment: I remembered watching _The Social Network_'s opening scene, where--after getting dumped by his girlfriend--Zuck gets drunk, has an idea for Facemash, and live-blogs his development throughout the night.

While I don't foresee myself blogging anything nearly as dramatically as what happens in the movie, I figured a blog was interesting enough both as a writing platform and in terms of the engineering/implementation challenge behind it.
